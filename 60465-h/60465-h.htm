<p class="larger noindent">DON. By <span class="smcap">Rudolf Besier</span>.</p>

<p>“Mr. Besier is a man who can see and think for himself, and
constructs as setting for the result of that activity a form of his
own. The construction of ‘Don’ is as daring as it is original.”—Mr.
Max Beerbohm in <i>The Saturday Review</i>.</p>

<p>“It is a fresh and moving story ... and full of good things.”—Mr.
A. B. Walkley in <i>The Times</i>.</p>

<p>“‘Don’ is a genuine modern comedy, rich in observation and
courage, and will add to the author’s reputation as a sincere
dramatist.”—Mr. E. F. Spence in <i>The Westminster Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>“If the essence of drama be conflict, the wrestle of will, then
‘Don,’ by Rudolf Besier, comes as near as any play I know to
essential drama. It is a sparring match in heaven knows how
many rounds.”—Mr. William Archer in <i>The Nation</i>.</p>

<p class="larger noindent">THE EARTH. By <span class="smcap">James B. Fagan</span>.</p>

<p>“A magnificent play—at one and the same time a vital and
fearless attack on political fraud, and a brilliantly written
strong human drama. Moreover, the lighter interludes are
written with a brilliance and a polished humour with which
one had not credited Mr. Fagan hitherto”—<i>The Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>“‘The Earth’ must conquer every one by its buoyant irony,
its pungent delineations, and not least by its rich stores of
simple and wholesome moral feeling.... The credit may be
equally divided between the vivacity and iridescence of its
witty and trenchant dialogue and the tenacious grip of its
searching and most substantial issues.”—<i>The Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“An interesting and remarkable achievement.”—<i>The Westminster
Gazette.</i></p>

built in an oak-tree at “Ultima Thule.” The
stage, slightly raised, represents the platform.
In the right-hand corner is the summer-house,
built on branches a few feet higher than the
platform. The entrance to the platform is
through a square hole, reached by a ladder
from beneath. The tree, a vast, ancient, and
mossy oak, comes straight through the centre
of the platform, its branches spreading aloft in
every direction.</i></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Baldwin.</span></p>

<p>Thir-teen!... Good heavens, Baldwin, what

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

The gillyflowers and eglantine, myrtle, rosemary,
columbine, and daffydowndillies. Not—how
strange and dreadful! Thirteen!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Baldwin.</span></p>

<p>Yes, ’um. And if I was, fac’s won’t change for
the wishin’. Thirteen’s the number, and thirteen
it’s like to remain, seeing as Mrs. Baldwin’s turned
sixty-three.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid I don’t quite understand what you’re
talking about.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Baldwin.</span></p>

<p>I——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>You needn’t repeat it.... Oh, I remember now
why I sent for you, Baldwin. I wonder if, without
hurting the beauty of the tree, you could open
a window to the sunset?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Baldwin.</span></p>

<p>Open a winder?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>You don’t understand me? Let me put it
differently! I should like you to cut away some
of the foliage so that I can watch the sun dropping
behind the hills.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Baldwin.</span></p>

<p>Yes, m’lady. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I know what you are going to say. When we
built this place in the tree, I gave you special
directions not to touch the western foliage as it
hid the view of Ashurst Manor, which I found
distressingly unsightly. Yes! But since my
aunt, Mrs. O’Farrel, has taken the house, it seems
to me far less offensive. Likes and dislikes are,
after all, so much a matter of temperament and
association! The former owner was an impossible
person.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Baldwin.</span></p>

<p>The Scotch gentleman?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>He was a Jew, Baldwin, though his name was
Mackintosh. I don’t wish to speak of him. When
you cut the foliage, please use restraint and feeling.
On no account disfigure the tree. Watch
from this spot the sun going down, and lop away
a little branch here and a little branch there, so as
to give me some perfect glimpses of gold and rose.</p>

and I liked it. I love it now that you have come

weary months I’ve lived in the past and future,
on memories and anticipations. Now, at last I

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Directly the boat came alongside. But it took
me a deuce of a time to make out! My French is
a bit rusty, and the rotters had jumbled up some
of the words. As it is, I only made out the gist
of it—to take an earlier train from London than
I’d intended, and to call on you before going on
to Ashurst, as I’d find you alone in a summer-house
you’d built on some tree or other. The
twiddly bits of the message didn’t somehow seem
to make sense....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>The ... twiddly bits?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Yes; something about a star in red water, and
horses with white manes. Couldn’t make it out
at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>That was a quotation from De Musset, my poor
boy.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Great Scott! I thought it was a cypher. People
don’t generally quote poetry in their telegrams.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>In any case, it seemed to me a bit rash of you
to send the wire at all—even in French.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, did it? As a matter of fact, I used French,
not to conceal the message, but because the language
seemed to me so beautifully appropriate
for making a clandestine meeting.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>By Jove! Fancy thinking of that!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>To sin beautifully is the less a sin. Don’t
forget, dear, that, however innocent, our love is
wrong. We should never neglect an opportunity
of ennobling it with little touches of beauty, should
we?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Rather not!... So Michael’s away?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Only this afternoon. He has gone to a garden
party at the Fitzgeralds’. Your mother’s there as
well. Everybody’s there. But I wanted to see
you for a little while before any one else, so I
sent you that wire and pretended a headache.
A petty deceit that avenged itself! For directly
I told it, I felt a slight twinge of neuralgia.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Hard luck! But it’s better, dear, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I suppose it is. But you mustn’t say “hard
luck.” My life, alas! is so full of deceits that
when one of them is punished, I always try to
be grateful. But tell me now, about yourself—everything
that has happened these last months.
Your letters have been too full of facts to tell
me anything. And I do so long to hear all your
news....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Patricia....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Yes, dear?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>What an awfully good woman you are!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Am I?... I wonder!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>And your eyes are simply ripping.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Are they?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>And your hands, by Jove!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>What of my hands, dear?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>They’re simply ripping.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Dear heart! (<i>Stroking his head.</i>) Dear soft
hair. But I’m waiting.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Oh yes, I forgot. But there really ain’t much
to tell that I haven’t told you in my letters.
I arrived in New York on a Saturday after an
awfully jolly passage. Those big Cunarders are
corking boats. Had a bit of a dust-up at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Customs, but I squared the chap with a ten-dollar
bill. A chap on board advised me to put up at
the Waldorf-Astoria. He told me it was one of
their swaggerest hotels, but I must say——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Laughing.</i>) Yes, yes, dear, you’ve told me all
that before! And about the nigger waiter whose
thumb was always in the soup—and the Californian
peach as big as a baby’s head—and the factory
that was burned down in Chicago—and the card-sharper
who tried to swindle you at poker, “but
he got hold of the wrong chap, by Jove!”—and
so many other thrilling details. (<i>Almost with
passion, taking his face in her hands.</i>) You darling!
Oh, you darling!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>I thought I’d told you everything.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Of course you did—everything. (<i>With far-off
eyes.</i>) I wonder why I am so foolish as to expect
the essentials from you—those labourings of the
soul at midnight, yearnings, ecstasies, and long,
long thoughts under the stars. If you had been
capable of these I should never have loved you.
It’s just your simplicity and eternal boyishness
that took my heart. Poor Michael’s spiritual
nature, his dreams, his subtlety, his devotion, never
touched me deeper than the intellect. I mistook
sympathy for love—I seemed to have found a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
kindred spirit—I married him. Yes! we are all
born to suffer and endure.... Which reminds
me, my poor dear boy, you must be dying for tea.
(<i>Pouring out the tea.</i>) I hope you had some
lunch?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Rather! I had a luncheon-basket in the train,
and put away the best part of a chicken, among
other things.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>How young and hungry you are!</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>(<i>Hands him a cup of tea with a lemon slice
in the saucer.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>I say!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Yes, dear?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Have you any milk or cream?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Sorrowfully.</i>) Oh, Bill!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>I can’t help it. This Russian mess ain’t a
Christian drink. I can’t think how you can
swallow it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I don’t suppose I like it any better than you,
dear. But the mixture of cream and tea, as I have
often told you, produces an odious colour—and I
refuse to encourage it. You should try to do
likewise.... However, you will find cream in
the summer-house.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Right-ho! (<i>Goes into summer-house.</i>) Hullo!
Good man! Here’s whisky-and-soda. (<i>Talking
in the summer-house, half to himself, half to her.</i>)
That’s the stuff! Nothing like a syphonated spot
when one’s got a real thirst! No tea for me,
thanks.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>To herself, smiling.</i>) Dear babbler....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Coming down, a glassful in his hand.</i>) Here’s
to you, Patricia!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>In a deep voice, looking into eternity.</i>) We
are all born to suffer, to endure, to renounce....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well! I’ll drink that Russian stuff if you
like.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I was not thinking of tea. I was thinking of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Unfeignedly relieved.</i>) Yes, it’s an awfully
hard world. (<i>Takes a long draught.</i>) By Jove,
that’s clinking good!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>It becomes more and more difficult to play my
part, and return Michael’s love, which seems to
grow stronger and deeper day by day. His eyes
follow my every movement, his mind anticipates
my every wish, he surrounds me with an atmosphere
of passionate worship. Few women have ever
received such love. It is the love that poets dream
of—the love that must follow those marriages that
are made in heaven.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Good Lord, it’s awfully rough on you!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I think and I think and I think, but I can see
no solution to the mystery. Surely love is the
best gift of God, and that such love as Michael’s—so
noble, so pure, so unselfish—should be utterly
wasted, is inconceivable. It must be that I am
unworthy.</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>(<i>She pauses expectantly.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>And it puts me in such a rotten position. If
Michael treated you badly, I shouldn’t care a rap
how much I made love to you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>With slight asperity.</i>) Can it be that I am
unworthy?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>As it is I often feel such a beastly cad....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Then you think me unworthy?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>I?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>You never denied it.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>But I didn’t know you wanted me to! You’re
worthy of anything! You know that!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Dear, dear boy! But am I? I wonder!
Heaven only knows how desperately I tried to love
him, and when I found it impossible, how I never
faltered in pretending a love equal to his. And
I knew that it would kill him should he learn
the truth. But if the part I played was difficult
before you came, after you came, and I knew what
love was, it was almost beyond my power. And
yet I drew strength somehow, not only to resist
temptation and keep our love pure, but never by
word, deed, or expression to let Michael suspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for one moment that his devotion was not returned.
Yes! I think a woman who has done all this
cannot be altogether unworthy.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>You’re—you’re a saint—you’re an angel!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Am I? I wonder!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>You really are!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Dear, inarticulate boy!... And, Bill, remember
this. We have put our hands to the plough,
and there must be no turning back. The martyrdom
which must be lifelong has only just begun.
I feel I shall find strength to play my bitter rôle
to the final curtain. For I love renunciation,
endurance, and purity. They are such exquisite
virtues. And virtue is very beautiful.... But
you are made of more earthly materials, my poor
boy. Do you realise that your love must always
remain unsatisfied? Can you love me without the
faintest hope of more reward than a look, a touch,
a kiss?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>That’s all right, Patricia. Don’t you worry
about me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>That’s all right!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I can only offer you the shadow; your nature
will some day cry out for the substance.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Not it!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Ah, if only I had the strength and courage to
bid you good-bye for ever!</p>

<p>There must be at least half a dozen flies on
Patricia’s face.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Never mind the flies—it’s their turn for the
moment.... Why did you refuse me, Eileen?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Because my love for you made me a blind fool!
I misunderstood your admiration for women. I
thought your homage of every girl you met, personal—not
universal, as I learned too late—a
superb compliment to the whole sex. Dear friend,
I repented in sackcloth and ashes! Not that
O’Farrel wasn’t a good fellow, every inch of him.
He made life very happy. But life with you—well,
I missed it!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Will you marry me, Eileen?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>I’m far too old for a boy like you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Is this final?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Final.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Ah!... Your companionship would have
been so good for Clare. A tactfully restraining
influence....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>I doubt it. I’m too much in sympathy with the
child.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>But you wouldn’t encourage her to tell every
one she meets—including the Bishop—that she is
an Atheist, or ride astride through the town without
the formality of—er—divided skirts....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>No—perhaps not. (<i>She lowers her voice.</i>) I
should first of all put a stop to her galavantin’
about every other day with Michael.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Really, my dear Eileen, I think the friendship
between Michael Cosway and Clare is wholly
charming and can only do the child good. Surely
you don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>No, of course I don’t! Michael’s far too infatuated
with your sleeping beauty there. Still, I’d
put a stop to it. And then I should marry your
daughter to Bill with indecent haste.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Eh, what? Your son? Dear me!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Why shouldn’t they marry? They are obviously
kindred spirits.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know your son sufficiently well to—er——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>A thoroughly healthy, young animal....
You’ll meet him in a moment. I hear the
motor....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>How quick they’ve been!... Marry them!
Dear me!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Now then, Mr. Dean, to work!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Birds’-nesting?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Gravely.</i>) And you took a saucer up with you

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Oh, did I?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Of course. It’s the usual thing to do when you
go birds’-nesting. Didn’t you always take a saucer
with you as a boy, Mr. Cosway?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>I can’t say I remember doing so.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Laughing.</i>) Do stop talking nonsense, Clare!...
Really, Bill, I’m curious to know quite a
lot of things. Why did you take an earlier train?
Why did you come here? Why did you climb up
the tree with a saucer? Why did you let Michael
and Miss Lesley fetch you at the station? And
why did you remain in the tree while the Dean
and I—er——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Talked over old times together.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Talked over old times together. It’s all rather
mysterious.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Unusual....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>I dropped a rotten branch.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Quite so. And the Dean thought a squirrel had
done it.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>Oh yes, you caught sight of my tail!</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>(<i>He goes into a shout of lonely laughter.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>That’s all very well. But what was your idea
in playing such a prank? It seems to me rather
childish.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Primitive....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>Very.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Quite.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>With disarming vivacity.</i>) Oh, my dear, dear
friends, why do you take this so heavily? Surely
a charming piece of boyishness! May I tell them
what happened, Cousin Bill? I saw through the
whole thing at once.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure you did.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>He so longed to see his mother that he came
down by an earlier train.... Didn’t you,
Cousin Bill?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>That’s right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>But when he arrived he found she had gone to
a garden party. He was so disappointed....
Weren’t you, Cousin Bill?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Bill.</span></p>

<p>That’s right.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Did you learn to say “that’s right” in
America? It sounds so successful.... When he
found his mother was out, he thought he would
come and see Michael and—me. Michael had gone
to the garden party, but he was told that I was
here. He found me asleep....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Imitating <span class="smcap">Lady Patricia’s</span> voice and manner.</i>)
And he kissed me—didn’t you, Cousin Bill?</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Bill</span> goes into a shout of long and lonely
laughter.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>In a pained voice.</i>) He found me asleep.
I had not been feeling very well....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>Are you better, my darling?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Thank you, Michael dear, a little better....
He found me asleep. He was thirsty, poor fellow!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
So he helped himself to tea. Providentially, Ellis
had brought two cups. Then he saw you all
coming, and thought it would be “such jolly fun”
to climb up the tree and drop a saucer....
Didn’t you?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>—Cousin Bill.</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Bill</span> laughs.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>He had meant to do it at once. But he couldn’t
resist the joke of letting Clare and Michael fetch
him at the station. And when they had gone he
simply had to wait till they came back again—or,
perhaps, the Dean and Aunt Eileen were so enjoying
each other’s company, he hadn’t the heart to
disturb them.... Then Clare and Michael
returned, and he thought the joke had gone far
enough.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>So he threw a saucer at us.</p>

an external galaxy. In which case——</p>

<p>What on earth——!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Shrilly from above.</i>) Don’t you dare to look
up here, Baldwin—nor you, Mi—Mr. Cosway! If
there’s something white to be seen it’s certainly
not for you to look at! (<i><span class="smcap">Baldwin</span> continues

Oh! Tell him to turn his head somewhere else.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael and Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Birds’-nesting!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I don’t believe there’s a nest here at all. He was
simply kidding us.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Baldwin.</span></p>

<p>If it’s h’eggs you’re wantin’, miss, there’s a rare
lot of ’em in the ivy up at the ’ouse. Sparrers—drat’em!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>To <span class="smcap">Michael</span>.</i>) What an amazing young
creature! (<i>To <span class="smcap">Clare</span>.</i>) But you’ll ruin your
frock, my child.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I can’t help that. I mean to find out whether
there’s a nest here or not. Besides, I simply
couldn’t hang around while you and Mr. Cosway
were canoodleing.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Puzzled.</i>) Canoodleing?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Spooning.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Shrugs her shoulders and speaks to <span class="smcap">Michael</span>

very pleasant to dine here, Michael. I’ll go indoors
and change into something warmer.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>You’re not cold, my love?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>No, no, dear, no. But I might be later on.
(<i>To <span class="smcap">Baldwin</span>, who has been staring fixedly into
the branches.</i>) What are you doing, Baldwin?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Baldwin.</span></p>

<p>It’s main ’ard to keep a h’eye on the sun, m’lady,

arst, mum, if the sun’s ’bout right for loppin’ off

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>A cup and a glass!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Languidly.</i>) Oh, I suppose Cousin Bill left
them up there. You needn’t trouble to bring them
down, Clare. Baldwin can fetch them.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>He seems to have been doing himself uncommonly
well. I daresay I shall find plates, knives and
forks, napkins and finger-bowls. What ho!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>(<i>To <span class="smcap">Lady Patricia</span>.</i>) Has that fellow gone
quite off his head?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Going out.</i>) Bill? Oh, no, dear! Oh, no!
It’s only youth—youth will out! Beautiful rose-white

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Turning on him.</i>) Then why do you always
annoy me by making love to—to your wife when
I’m there? (<i><span class="smcap">Michael</span> still kneels on the cushion,

you speak?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>Clare——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>(<i>With a sudden burst of laughter.</i>) Oh, get up
from that cushion! You don’t know what a fool
you look! (<i><span class="smcap">Michael</span> gets up with a pained
expression and stands staring tragically before
him. A pause. She speaks in a gentler voice.</i>)
Well, Mike?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>Since I have spoken so much and done you
wrong and Patricia wrong, I must tell you all and
throw myself on your mercy.... When I
married Patricia I sincerely believed I loved her.
She seemed to me a kindred spirit—with her sensitive,
beautiful nature. I found out too late that
love depends as often on mutual difference as
mutual sympathy. My love for her never went
deeper than the intellect. Oh, the tragedy of it!
She is such a fair, white soul, and so worthy of
my whole love!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>If you don’t love her, why do you pretend to?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>Can’t you see—can’t you see I have no alternative?
Patricia’s love for me is unearthly in its
depth and intensity. She worships me, little as
I deserve it. If for one moment she thought my
love had slackened, that moment would be her
last. You don’t know how sensitive she is....
Do you suppose, Clare, I enjoy playing this dreadful
game? But I must—it is my duty. I have
sworn to love and cherish her.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>(<i>After a pause, going up to him.</i>) Michael,
how long have you loved me?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>Almost since first I met you, you wild thing!
You soul of youth and incarnation of the morning!</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>(<i>He looks longingly down at her.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Clare....</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>(<i>He hesitates.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Get it over soon. (<i>He bends down and kisses
her reverently, then turns away from her with
tragic eyes.</i>) Didn’t you like it?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>But the wrong I am doing you, and the wrong
I am doing Patricia....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>But if Patricia doesn’t know and I don’t mind,
I don’t see where the wrong comes in.... Do
you?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Taking her hands.</i>) Do you love me, Clare?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know.... Yes, I think I do. You’re
such a solemn old donkey!... Michael, if I
love you, will it really make you a happier
man?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>Happier? Oh, my dear, with the knowledge of
your love I should be able to endure anything!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Even Patricia?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>Hush, Clare, hush!... Patricia’s is a pure
and delicate soul. It is I who am unworthy, since
I cannot return her wonderful love.... Little
girl, do you understand that this love of yours
may bring much suffering into your life? I
can never, by word or deed, change my attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
towards Patricia—never! She must never know
that I do not love her.... And what of us?
Our love must stand alone in the world. It must
be something wholly pure and noble and self-sacrificing—the
love that asks for nothing, that
hopes for nothing—the love of the angels that
neither marry nor are given in marriage....
Do you realise all this?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Yes.... You see, Mike, I always believe in
platonic love.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>(<i>A little doubtfully.</i>) Platonic....</p>

quite forgotten it was father’s sermon night when

which <span class="smcap">Lady Patricia</span> has had built up to the
platform on the left. It is a beautiful night in
early June. The full moon spreads a network
of shadows on the platform, and a few large
stars twinkle through the leaves. Suspended
from the branches by pieces of silken string
attached to nails driven into the trunk of the
tree are several elaborate Chinese lanterns.
Empty coffee-cups and liqueur glasses stand
on two small tables in the background. There
are one or two chairs about in addition to

<p>(<i>When the curtain rises, <span class="smcap">Baldwin</span> is seen

divinely in the distance. <span class="smcap">Baldwin</span> listens
for a moment. The singing ceases. He
shakes his head gloomily, glances into the

<p>Well, please yourself, Mr. Baldwin, please yourself.
My motter’s “Live an’ let live.” Yes, as I
was saying, it’s a queer game of ’ide-and-seek
they’re playing at. I saw young O’Farrel just
now by the yew-trees. ’E caught sight of ’er
ladyship comin’ up the path, and dived into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
shadder like a frightened rabbit. Bit queer considering
’ow thick they are. I just stood aside
to see if anything was going to ’appen. Then ’oo
should come along but the master! They must
have caught sight of each other at the same time.
She gave a sorter jump an’ stood still. ’E cut
and ’urried into the bushes. Then she turned and
’urried back the way she’d come. What d’yer say

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>I am. Those two <i>had</i> been quarrelling just
now.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>That was evident—even to me.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>They had been quarrelling bitterly—and I can
make a shrewd guess at the cause.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I also.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Indeed. Well, I think it’s high time to speak
plainly.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I quite agree with you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>I’m glad to hear it.... Bill had very
evidently been taking your daughter to task for
her amazing indiscretions.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Amazing indiscretions? Clare’s? Will you
kindly be more explicit.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>I mean to be. Perhaps you remember some
weeks ago I warned you that her intimacy with
Michael Cosway ought to be stopped?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Certainly. And I took leave to disagree with
you entirely.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Well, you were wrong. You should immediately
have put an end to this intimacy—to use the
mildest word for her friendship with Michael.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. O’Farrel, is it possible you are speaking of
my daughter?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>And it’s your duty to put an end to it at once.
I only hope that you may not be too late.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>This—this—this is beyond anything!... Perhaps
you will be so good——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Now then, Dean, pray don’t lose your temper.
It’s neither wise nor becoming, and at our age
very bad for the heart. Listen to me quietly for
a moment. I refused for a long time to believe
any ill of this—er—friendship. I knew Michael to
be infatuated with his wife, and Clare to be a
healthy-minded girl. But last week Emily Fitzgerald
told me she had seen Michael walking in
the Stanton Woods with his arm around Clare’s
shoulder. She added that the affair was becoming
quite notorious in the neighbourhood.... You
must act, and act at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Is that all? So you condescend to listen to the
tittle-tattle of a notorious old gossip like Emily
Fitzgerald? Upon my word I’m ashamed of you!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Dean! Have you taken leave of your senses?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I might well put that question to you, Mrs.
O’Farrel. But I refrain from vulgar <i>tu quoque</i>
repartee. I have no more to say except to warn
you that before looking after the morals of my
daughter, you had far better look after those of
your son.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>My son?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Precisely—your son.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I and others—unlike yourself, I will not drag in
the names of outsiders—have for some time past
watched your son and Lady Patricia with grief
and dismay.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Patricia!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Just now you believed your son had been impertinently
taking Clare to task for her charming
friendship with Michael Cosway. I am convinced
you were mistaken. It was Clare who had been
warning your son that his indiscretions were becoming
the talk of the place.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Bill entangled with Patricia! And Clare—<i>Clare</i>
preaching propriety! It’s too laughable! A boy’s
innocent homage for a woman at least ten years
his senior! You’re a very foolish old man.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Again I put away from me the <i>tu quoque</i> retort....
Add two and two together. I don’t for a
moment blame <i>her</i>. I can’t find it in my heart
to blame her. The dear and beautiful creature is
as God made her: exquisitely sensitive, sentimental
and infinitely affectionate.... But I warn
you, Mrs. O’Farrel, I warn you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>I refuse to hear another word. You ought to be
ashamed of yourself!... And the saddest part
of the whole affair is my poor boy’s undoubted
affection for your daughter.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Affection for Clare! I don’t believe it!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Are you his mother?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Certainly not!... But I have watched him—with
the result that I am convinced of his
infatuation for Lady Patricia.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Fiddle-sticks!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>And I may as well tell you, though you will not
believe it, that my poor girl’s affections are centred
on your son.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Oh, dam’ foolishness!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>This has gone far enough, Mrs. O’Farrel.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

your love is deeper and stronger than it was.
But this sacred love—this hopeless love of ours
has swept you suddenly into manhood. You are
no longer a boy; you are graver; you are sadder....
And if sometimes you seem to avoid me now,
it’s due to no cooling of passion, but to the fear

<p>—That you shouldn’t even pretend to hide your

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Satisfaction! I assure you, dear lady, I’m
shocked and grieved—deeply grieved, that your

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>My son! You know as well as I do that the
foolish boy has been bewitched by that unprincipled
woman.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Come, come, Eileen. In common fairness we
should apportion the blame equally—though, indeed,
my experience has generally led me to the
conclusion that the <i>man</i> is more to blame in these
cases than the woman.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p><i>Your</i> experience! Quite so!... I shall give
Patricia my plain, unvarnished opinion of herself
and forbid her my house. You will tell Michael
that he’s a scoundrel and a libertine.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>No, no, no! Tact, tact, my dear Eileen, tact
and diplomacy!... Let us calmly review the
position. Cosway’s and Lady Patricia’s relations
with Clare and your son, though highly culpable,
appear to be blameless of the worst, and considerably
more—er—ardent on the part of the
married couple than of the single. So much is—er—unhappily
evident. Now, do you still maintain
that your son is—er—interested in Clare?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>I am certain of it.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Incredible! Of course, I <i>know</i>—in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
appearances—that Clare feels strongly for your
son.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Fudge!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Now, my dear Eileen, pray don’t fall back on
contradiction. What we have both got to do is
to bring these young people together——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Hush! D’you hear? (<i>She goes quickly to the
back and looks out. A pause.</i>) All four of
them! Of course, they went up to the house to
look for us.... What shall we do?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Ah! (<i>Goes to the railing at the back.</i>) Allow

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>A little tired. Perhaps you slept badly?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I’m as fit as a fiddle, and I slept like a log.</p>

<p>These peaches are delicious. Try one.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Aren’t there any cherries yet?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid not. “Fruits in due season,” you
know, my dear!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>What about your peaches?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>That’s different, quite different. An early peach
cannot be too early. They live in glass houses——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Significantly.</i>) And don’t throw their stones....
I’ll have a cup of tea.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>There’s an omelette with asparagus-tops on the
way.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I’m not hungry.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Oh, that’s a pity! I suppose it’s this exceptionally
early summer.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Yes. I was unbearably hot all night. And so
thirsty that I drank nearly all the water in my
jug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Dear me! Wasn’t there any in the carafe?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I drank that as well.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Really? It seems to me that for a log you were
somewhat restive last night.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>A log?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I thought you slept like a log.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I scarcely slept a wink.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Well, well, my dear, so long as you feel—to
use your expression—as fit as a fiddle, it——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I feel rotten.</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>I’m sorry. I didn’t go to bed until very late myself.
Those little additions to my sermon took me
longer than I had anticipated. (<i><span class="smcap">John</span> and <span class="smcap">Robert</span>

This looks most inviting. And as there doesn’t
seem to be much of it, I’m not, on the whole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
sorry that you’ve lost your appetite this morning!
It’s an ill wind that——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>May I have some, please?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Well, of course, if you grudge me a little piece
of your omelette——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Not at all, my dear! Not at all!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>You needn’t give me three-quarters of it.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Very well. You had better take the other piece,
then.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Impatiently she takes the larger helping.</i>)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Oh, for goodness’ sake, father, take the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
lot! I’m sure I don’t want to deprive you of your
food!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>What a peppery young lady it is! I was only
joking.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I may be sadly lacking in humour, but jokes
about omelettes and the condition of one’s stomach
never much appealed to me.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Really, my dear child, I should much prefer
your not using that word.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Oh! I do hope you’re not going to suggest
I should say “Little Mary”!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Puzzled.</i>) Little Mary? I—er—don’t quite
see the connection.... Is there any reason for
alluding to that—er—portion of the anatomy?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I was under the impression that <i>you</i> made the
first allusion to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>My dear, I merely mentioned the fact that I
was hungry.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Well, you’re not hungry with your foot, are
you?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you think this bickering rather silly and
childish?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Very.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>(<i>After a pause, and with a change of voice but
unabated cheerfulness.</i>) Unclouded sunshine and
a sense of deep peace and repose! My ideal of
an English Sunday! John told me just now that
he feels inclined to sing the <i>Te Deum</i> on mornings
like this.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Why don’t you come to the point, father?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>The point?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I don’t quite understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I think you owe me some explanation of your
extraordinary action last night.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p><i>My</i> extraordinary action!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Yes—in deliberately hiding yourself in the
summer-house to overhear a private conversation.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>You amaze me, Clare! Instead of being grateful
for my silence on the events of yesterday, you
turn on me as though you had a grievance! My
action was amply justified by the circumstances.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I don’t see how eavesdropping can ever be justified.
And now you’re bent on giving us “beans”
from the pulpit. I’m awfully sorry to have to
say it, father, but really it’s rotten bad
form....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>We won’t discuss the matter any further. Believe
me, I am the best judge of my actions.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>And I of mine.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>You refer to the unhappy discoveries Mrs.
O’Farrel and I made last night?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Certainly, if you’re heartily ashamed of yourself,
you’re a competent judge of your actions.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I’m not in the least ashamed of myself.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Then, my dear child——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>And why should I be? I’ve done nothing
wrong.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>You have done very wrong indeed. But I don’t
wish to exaggerate. Of course, I know this has
been nothing more than a foolish flirtation. Reprehensible—most
reprehensible. A grave error, but
scarcely a sin. We will say no more about it....
One thing, however, I am bound to insist
upon after what came to my knowledge last night.
You must have nothing more to do with that young
man.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>What young man? Michael’s forty, if he’s a
day.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I was not speaking of Mr. Cosway. Honestly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
your future relations with him don’t cause me
acute anxiety. I was alluding to young O’Farrel.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Sitting up.</i>) Bill!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I think, my dear, we will leave the use of his
Christian name to the unhappy lady—or ladies—with
whom he is intimate. Certain facts have
come to my knowledge. He is not a fit companion
for a young girl. Your acquaintance with him
must cease from to-day.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>Oh!... And may I ask what he has done?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>It is quite superfluous to go into—er—unsavoury
details.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>You seriously expect me to cut him because
he doesn’t quite meet with your approval?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I expect you to obey me implicitly.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Rising.</i>) I had better tell you at once, father,
that I shall do nothing of the kind.</p>

<div class="direction">

<p>(<i>The gateway bell rings.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Clare! (<i>The <span class="smcap">Dean</span> looks at the gateway and
lowers his voice.</i>) You forget yourself!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>His crime hasn’t by chance anything to do with
Patricia?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>H’m—well, since you appear to know something
about this, it would be—er—affectation on my part
to deny it. His conduct has been shameful, outrageous,
and ungentlemanly.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>His conduct has been splendid. That detestable
creature got hold of him somehow, and he behaved
perfectly from start to finish. Of course you side
with her because you think her pretty. But——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>We won’t discuss the matter any further, my
child. You are very young and headstrong and
inexperienced, and must learn to repose implicit
faith in your father’s judgment. You are not to
see this young man again.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clare.</span></p>

<p>I’m sorry, father, but I refuse to obey you.</p>

him now! I won’t go to church to be preached at.

I won’t.</p>

of ’em is female. (<i>He tots them off on his fingers.</i>)

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Well?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I said it first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>And I’m a woman.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>True. To begin with I’ve just received these
two notes. (<i>Hands her the letters.</i>)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Opening a letter.</i>) From Patricia!... Now
I really wonder whether this terribly agitated
handwriting is put on.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Be generous, Eileen!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>What on earth does the woman mean by scrawling
“Sunrise” on the top of the page?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Presumably that was when she wrote the letter.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I see! She wants you to believe she paced
her room in wakeful agony all night. (<i>Reads.</i>)
“Sunrise. I have need of confession. I will call
at the Deanery before morning service—<span class="smcap">Patricia
Cosway</span>.” Confession! Evidently she means to
enjoy herself!... (<i>Opens the other note and
reads.</i>) “<span class="smcap">Dear Dean</span>,—I am calling on you before
morning service to-day. I trust, in spite of all
that has happened, you will not refuse to receive
me—<span class="smcap">Michael Cosway</span>.” Very interesting. What
do you intend to do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Honestly, I haven’t made up my mind yet.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>I protest against your giving Patricia and yourself
the luxury of private confession. She owes
<i>me</i> her precious confession, not <i>you</i>. Have her out
here, and we’ll trounce her together.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Poor woman!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Fiddle-de-dee! She’s having the time of her
life. I wonder whether they’ve confessed to each
other.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I shouldn’t think so—but I mean that they
shall.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>So do I.... Well, Dean, I’ve had it out with
my son.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Ah....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Driving home last night I talked about the
likelihood of a thunderstorm, Crême de Menthe and
lawn-tennis, and made him thoroughly uncomfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Then you said nothing about——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Not a word. And we both went to bed. He
came down to breakfast in a shocking temper. I
cheerfully exhausted two tedious subjects: the
House of Lords and domestic servants. Suddenly
he lost his manners—cut me short—and plunged
into the sad story of Patricia and himself....
Now, I’d had time to think the matter over! I
treated the whole thing as a youthful peccadillo
and mildly suggested he had better put an end
to it. The poor dear boy was completely floored.
I’m sure he’d prepared himself against a regular
tornado. He simply sat there and stared at me....
Then abruptly I turned the conversation on
to your daughter.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>I described her conduct as scandalous, herself as
a hussy, and wound up with a burst of gratitude
that he’d been Patricia’s victim instead of hers.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Most remarkable! And what did the young
man say?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>He dazzled me with an amazing flare-up. Exhausted
his vocabulary on my injustice and Clare’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
perfections, and stormed out of the room, leaving
me with tingling ears.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>And now?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Presumably he’s gone in search of this maligned
young woman. My blessings attend on him!...
Well, Dean, I’m a brilliant and original tactician,
what?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Brilliant, certainly—original, no!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>No?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Not ten minutes ago I adopted precisely the
same tactics with Clare and achieved precisely
the same result. She’s searching for your worthless
son at present.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Upon my word, I should never have credited
you with so much sense!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>My dear Eileen, I put down the tragedy of so
many women’s lives——</p>

<p>No, Dean; it’s neither unexpected nor a

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I must really beg of you, Eileen! (<i>To
<span class="smcap">Patricia</span>.</i>) Won’t you sit down?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Who has been standing at the back in an

hand?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>(<i>At her side, and taking her black-gloved hand
in both of his.</i>) My dear lady!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Ah.... You were always large-minded and
gentle and tolerant.... Aunt Eileen....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>They told me you were here, so I came out.
I am determined to speak before you both. It
was not what I had meant to do. I had hoped
to lay bare my secret soul in secret to the Dean.
Deliberately I have chosen the fiercer ordeal. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
I expect and deserve no sympathy from you, no
mercy, no forgiveness, no understanding....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>I think I understand you well enough, Patricia.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>But do you? Oh, do you? Can any one so
sane and practical understand this living paradox?
Can prose ever understand poetry? I am the
refined essence of spirit and sense. I am a thing
of fire and dew. I have in me the making of a
great saint and a great courtesan....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Hurriedly.</i>) Yes, yes; we quite understand....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Go ahead, Patricia.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>If you really understand, my task will be so
much the easier! For understanding is the beginning
of sympathy. And sympathy ends in
forgiveness.... Dean, Aunt Eileen—will you be
patient and listen to me for a moment?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Of course we will. But won’t you sit down?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I should prefer to stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>It’s more effective, Dean.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>What you overheard yesterday gave you only
a crude outline of my tragedy and sin. All the
colour, all the light and shadow were missing;
and without these you are bound to misjudge
me.... Ah! don’t believe for a moment I am
seeking to justify myself! No! No! There <i>can</i>
be no real justification for my sin.... But I <i>do</i>
want your understanding—I <i>do</i> want your pity—I
<i>do</i> want your pardon. And from you, Dean, I
have come for punishment—for penance——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Hand her over to Baldwin.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Baldwin?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Eileen! I beg of you!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>On the surface my marriage has been perfect.
Michael is the husband of old romance, steel-true,
chivalrous, and devoted—oh! as no man was ever
devoted to a woman before! (<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel</span>
and the <span class="smcap">Dean</span> exchange significant glances.</i>) But
he just lacked what the depths of my complex
nature cried out for—passion, simplicity, primeval
energy. These he hadn’t in him to give, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
wanted them, not knowing at first what I wanted....
But when Bill came into my life—I knew—I
knew ... and we rushed together, drawn by
the mystic gravitation of alien soul for soul.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>A moment, Patricia. I understand that my son
has “primeval energy.” I’ve never noticed it
myself. What are its manifestations?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you think we can leave that to—er—the
imagination?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Oh ... by all means! Then what do you
mean by “rushing together”?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I use the expression metaphorically ...
spiritually. (<i>With sudden drama.</i>) Dean—Aunt
Eileen—I swear to you by all that is beautiful
and sacred that our love has been pure. You
believe me? Ah, say you believe me!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Why, of course we do!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>If you swore to the contrary, I should call you
a liar! You’ve neither the strength nor the
courage to do more than play with sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I? I! Oh, how little you know me! Had you
looked into my heart when first this temptation
stole upon me you would have never said anything
so foolish.... Shall I ever forget those
long nights of battle when my skin was dry and
fevered—my pillow wet with tears? I lived with
clenched hands and bitten lip, and fixed my
thoughts steadfastly on high and holy things.
Yes, I fought the good fight well—and if I was
half defeated ... I am but human.... At
last it came—the day came when I lost the battle....
Spring was in the air, sweet perfumes of
budding and burgeoning things ... above my head
a blackbird fluted ... I had an early snowdrop
in my hand. He looked at me; I felt his eyes
devouring my face. Slowly I lifted mine—our
eyes met—and no force on earth could have torn
them apart; and the world reeled and sang about
us—— <i>Oh, and that bluer blue, that greener
green!...</i></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>That bluer blue—that——?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Stephen Phillips.... Ah, that moment! I
was mad—I was drunk with love and spring!</p>

too mysterious to be called funny. After that
I struggled no more against the stream. I drifted;
I was carried down the great ocean of love. But I
never once faltered in my high resolve to keep that
ocean pure, and——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Ocean? What ocean?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Sorry; my fault.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>To keep that ocean pure, and come what might,
to shield Michael from the least suspicion that his
wonderful love was not returned. Deceit? Oh,
yes! But surely, surely deceit is justified when
the alternative means—death!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Death! Dear me!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Do you really think poor Michael would succumb
if he learned the dreadful truth?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I know it. Have you ever seen such devotion
as his?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>It’s certainly remarkable....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Briskly.</i>) Now, Lady Patricia, are you prepared
to put yourself unreservedly in my hands?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I am.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Then I shall require two things of you. Firstly,
that you break off these relations with young
O’Farrel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I have determined on that already. I won’t speak
of the suffering it will cause <i>me</i>. I have merited
suffering and will bear it in silence. But when I
think of him——! My poor, poor boy! What is
to become of him without me?... Oh, you are
his mother—can you devise no means of softening
this blow for him?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Reverently.</i>) I think we may safely leave that
in the hands of Providence.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>I quite share your opinion. Secondly, Lady
Patricia, I wish you to tell your husband everything.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Genuinely startled.</i>) Michael!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Everything.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Very much in earnest.</i>) No—no. It’s impossible.
I could never think of doing that.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>You said just now you would place yourself
unreservedly in my hands.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>But I never dreamt you intended to punish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
innocent for my sin. Why should Michael’s life
and happiness be blighted because I’ve strayed
from righteousness?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>I think it’s just possible Michael may survive
the shock.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>And I know that it will kill him. It’s
impossible!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Sternly.</i>) I insist.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>And I refuse.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>That brings <i>me</i> into the fray! The Dean, as
your confessor, no doubt considers himself bound
to keep your story secret. I don’t. So look here,
Patricia; unless you make a clean breast of this
to Michael, I shall go to him with it myself.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>You!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>I.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>No! No! I don’t believe you’re capable of
such infamy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes I am.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>I don’t believe it. I don’t believe it! It would
be too cruel and wicked! Aunt Eileen, for pity’s
sake——</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Farrel.</span></p>

<p>You won’t get any pity out of me, my dear—not
an ounce! Either you or I tell Michael the story
from start to finish—and if <i>I</i> tell him, there won’t
be much left of your character when I’ve finished.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Wildly.</i>) What am I to do? What am I to
do? Dean—Dean—will you allow my aunt to
wreak her horrible vengeance on me by murdering
my husband?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Oh, but really, I don’t think it will be quite so
bad as that.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>But I know it—I know it!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dean.</span></p>

<p>Besides, how am I to prevent her—even if I

unfair to steal a march on me like this. For your
sake—for mine—they should have left the confession
to me. I would have withheld nothing. I
would have told you all of my own free will. But
they’ve spoken. And I see it—they’ve put the

last night. They have made you believe the
worst of me. But it’s not true, Patricia. I swear
it. It’s not true. (<i><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia</span> makes a

I have been faithful to the letter of our
marriage vow—I have been unfaithful to the spirit.
I am a man with a man’s passions, but for your
sake I fought and kept my sinful love pure. Doubt
all else—but believe that. You must believe it.
You shall.... I am not trying to excuse myself.
There is no excuse for what I have done.
But O, Patricia, you know that to love and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to love isn’t in our control. And if I never loved
you with all the passion I pretended ... I’m

you ever dream that your wonderful love was not

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>No.... Flapper.... Oh, how I’ve been

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>And to think of all I have gone through for
your sake—how I’ve forced myself to take your
kisses and return them—how for months and
months I fought and struggled to keep down the
one great passion of my life. All for your sake—all
because I thought you loved me! Oh, the
bitter irony of it!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean by this?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>But now the one obstacle to my love has been
removed. I will go to him now—I will put my
arms around him. He shall love me and I will
love him.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>What are you saying, Patricia? Are you mad?
Of whom are you speaking?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Bill. Bill O’Farrel—Bill, whom I love and who
loves me.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>Bill O’Farrel!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>For two years he has been the passion of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
soul. He will now become my heart’s delight.
Yes, Michael, you have taken my wonderful and
unrequited love for you too much for granted.
You have played the infatuated husband so
artistically that I believed in it to the extent of
playing the infatuated wife in return.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>You!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I! I remained with you—I pretended to
be absorbed in you, because I thought it would
kill you if you realised that I wanted something
more than you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>Bill O’Farrel....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>You, too! Ah, I see it all now—I see it all.
She said I must confess to you—that aunt—she
said the result would astonish me. And now—now
she’s hugging herself with vindictive joy at
having humiliated me to the dust. But she has
not finished with me yet. No! I can still strike
back—and strike I will! You have no love for
me. Very well. I know where to go for love.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Michael.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lady Patricia.</span></p>
